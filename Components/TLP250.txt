- Pin number one and four is not connected to any point physically. Therefore they are not in use.

- Pin number 8 is use to provide power supply to TLP250 and pin number 5 is ground pin which provides 
return path to power supply ground. Maximum power supply voltage between 15-30 volt dc can be given to TLP250. 
But it also depends on temperature of environment in which you are using TLP250.


- Pin number 2 and 3 are anode and cathode points of input stage LED. It works like a normal light emitting diode. 
It has similar characteristics of forward voltage and input current. Maximum input current is in the range of 7-10mA 
and forward voltage drop is about 0.8 volt. TLP250 provides output from low to high with minimum threshold current of 1.2mA and above.


- Pin number six and seven is internally connected to each other. Ouput can be taken from either pin number 6 and 7. 
Totem pole configuration of two transistor is used in TLP250. In case of high input , output becomes high with output voltage equal 
to supply voltage and in case of low input, output become low with output voltage level equal to ground.


- Mosfet driver TLP250 can be used up to 25khz frequency due to slow propagation delay.


TLP-250 Calculations

1) For 7-10mA, input R should be (5-0.8)/(7mA) >R> (5-0.8)/(10mA) = 600 Ohm >R> 420 Ohm
